As early as the 1400‚Äôs, there appeared to be resisitence to the early signs and intentions of enslavement behaviors exhibited by the Portuguese who had formed allences with many of the Ghanain inhabitants. Notibly, King Ansah of Ghana and the Fante people were one such group that persisted in their resistence. They refused to participate in the slave trade. They dimissed the Portuguese from thier land and kept watch for foreign vessels that sailed their waters and prevented them from embarking. They would kill any intruders that tried to come ashore. This held the European invaders at bay for a while but they were persistent in their efforts. They had an appetite for enslaving people.",

Christopher Columbus tried to appease the whites by being harsh on the Africans and Indians; there were many ill-fated revolts, but this one was significant. The rebellion was led by an enslaved African named Guaman√≠, originally from the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana). Guaman√≠ organized this revolt with a group of enslaved people and the indigenous Taino. They attacked the Spanish settlement of San Germ√°n, killing several colonizers and burning down buildings. The rebels then moved on to attack other settlements in the region. However, the Spanish authorities quickly responded to the rebellion, sending troops to suppress the uprising. The rebels were defeated after several battles; many were captured, forty slaves were shot, and many fled the island. Despite the revolt's failure, it was a powerful symbol of resistance against slavery and oppression. The legacy of Guaman√≠ and the other rebels has inspired subsequent generations of Puerto Ricans to fight for justice and equality. .",

However, historical records indicate that there was a rebellion of African slaves against their Spanish masters in the region at that time. According to some sources, the revolt was led by an African slave named Juan de Palomino, who had been brought to Colombia from the Congo. The slaves attacked and burned Spanish settlements and plantations, killing many of their masters. The Spanish authorities eventually crushed the revolt and punished the rebellious slaves harshly. Palomino and other leaders of the revolt were executed, and many other slaves were subjected to brutal torture and punishment. The 1533 slave revolt in Santa Marta was one of the earliest recorded slave uprisings in the Americas, and it demonstrated the deep-seated resentment and resistance that many African slaves felt towards their European masters.",

El Negro Miguel led the revolt with a group of enslaved Africans brought to the area to work on sugar plantations. Miguel escaped slavery after the master tried to punish him; he grabbed the sword and fought back. (Insert Image 2) Miguel founded a settlement populated by Africans and Indigenous peoples, called a Cimarr√≥n or Cumbe (escaped slave). He proclaimed himself the King, taking a queen, Guiomar, and establishing draconian rules to maintain order. Due to its location, it became necessary to wage attacks on small farms and plantations to acquire food and supplies. (image 3) Miguel would build an army of up to 1,500 people. The rebellion began on July 26, 1552, and quickly spread throughout the region; the settlement would be sieged with battles throughout his reign. (Image 4) The slaves seized control of several plantations and fought against Spanish troops sent to suppress the rebellion. In 1554, they captured a town, and killed a priest and six others. The revolt's aftermath was brutal, with many slaves being executed or forced to flee into the surrounding wilderness. After the killing of Miguel, many of the enslaved lost hope; most were executed, and the women and children were sent to surrounding plantations. (Images 5 & 6)",

The Spanish made many failed attempts to subdue the Africans, leading to a treaty signed in 1608 that held, among other things, that those in the settlement at that time would remain free, but anyone coming after 1608 would be returned to their masters.",

For several centuries they led a parallel life, also seizing from time to time the riches stored by others. (insertimage1)Armed with bows and spears and speaking a Bantu language, Amador became the hero of S√£o Tom√© power in.through conquest in 1595. He was able to maintain power for a while until the Portuguese managed to recapture it. In terms of size, duration, and impact, this can be considered one of the biggest slave revolts in all of Atlantic history; around 5000 blacks involved, which corresponded to half the slave population of the time in the island. Amador is still present in everyone's memory, and his profile is currently on all the banknotes of the country's currency, the duplicate, da dobra(insertimage3). This adventure is reminiscent of the quilombos of Brazil but unlike what happened in Portuguese-speaking America, the Angolares kept their freedom for a long time. The 4th of January of 1596 became a National Holiday.(insertimage2)",

In response, the African Brotherhood, a confraternity of Africans, carried her body in the funeral procession. It was at this point rumors began to fly that all white men would be killed and the women would be kept as concubines. The Spanish responded with harsh restrictions on the Black Mexicans, restricting movement and the ability to assemble. This became the precursor to the 1612 plot, when munitions were found among the enslaved, the executions began. \"Thirty-five blacks, including seven women, are publicly hanged in the main plaza of Mexico City for plotting an uprising of black slaves to overthrow Spanish power in Mexico\", 24 were beheaded and some were quartered and their bodies left to rot in the streets(Insertimage).",

Many other revolts were happening near this event on the islands. Whites in St. Kitts were much alarmed when a band of 60 women revolted in the French Quarter and fled to the hills. Then in November of that same year, more than 60 enslaved Africans from the Capisterre region left their plantations and found refuge on the slopes of Mount Misery. Accompanied by their women and children, they protected themselves by the surrounding environment on a mountainous precipice that a narrow strip of land could only approach. This vantage point enabled them to pillage the plantations of the slaveholders. After a stint of pillaging and destruction, they were eventually overtaken by an army of 500 men who destroyed and disbanded their stronghold. They were killed, punished, and made examples of to eliminate the attempts and actions of future rebellions by other enslaved people.",

In 1675 after three years of planning a slave named Fortuna leaked the plans that led to over 100 slaves being arrested and tortured. Forty Blacks were beheaded or burned alive, others committed suicide before being tortured. In 1692, over 200 slaves were involved in a rebellion and 90 were executed.",

They burnt down the entire colonial headquarters in Mauritius.

They set fire to the outhouse and when the whites appeared they attacked and killed 9 whites and injured 7 others. They were captured, six committed suicide rather that go to trial. \"Thirty-nine slaves stood trial for murder, witnesses were called to provide testimony, and surprisingly thirteen slaves were acquitted and an additional three slaves were later pardoned.

Nanny made a vow on Pumpkin Hill in 1737 to fight the British to death. When she did sign the treaty with the British she was wearing the teeth of her dead British enemies. She established Nanny Town which is still in existence. In 1977 she was awarded the posthumous honour of 'National Heroine'.",

During the assault, the Natchez freed the enslaved people in hopes of inciting an insurrection. (Insert 3)The combined force attacked a French settlement and killed approximately 200 of them, freed 275 enslaved people, leading to an established Maroon community in Mississippi. Despite their fear of an alliance between Africans and Indigenous people, the French were the first to arm the African captives. They conquered the Natchez with support from the Choctaw, Tunica, and Pro-French Natchez in 1730. When the Spanish took over the area, they abolished Indigenous slavery in 1763, leading to increased African enslavement.(Insert 2)",

The Spanish left their enslaved populations on the island , many of whom had fled to the mountains of the country. There were two major maroon groups totaling in the several thousands. The leeward group was led by Cudjoe and his brothers Accompong and Johnny. The other group, the Windwards was led by Cuffee, Quao, Kishee and the infamous female leader Nanny. The struggle with the British lasted well over nine years with the British conceding to negotiations. The British even used armed Blacks called \"Blackshots\" but many of them wound up negotiating with the Maroons and supplying them with munitions. The Maroon populations not only fought the British but frequently attacked European settlements for arms and rations. The negotiations gave land to the Maroon popuation if they agreed to return runaway slaves to the British, they also wanted to be repatriated to West Africa but were not allowed to return. Mark G.

(Image 2)There were events leading up to the revolt of natural disasters: (Image 3) a drought; infestation that led to the destruction of crops and starvation. More stringent controls were enforced to prevent the Africans from running away, leading to the eventual revolt. Most whites fled the island, particularly those their loyal Blacks warned. (Image 4) The Dutch elicited the support of the British colonies from Tortola and St. Kitts to quell the revolt. Still, they were unsuccessful-it was the role of the Free Negro Corps infantry in combination with the French that led to their defeat. Ultimately, over 48 plantations out of 92 were destroyed-killing 87 Blacks and 29 whites. The French implored the leader to surrender, and a deal would ensue; however, as soon as he did, he was murdered. Other rebels committed suicide rather than face capture. (Images 5 & 6)",

Over a single day, approximately \"five hundred men and a few women, representing one-third of the region's captives, had abandoned their work and resorted to violence.\" The number of rebelling slaves quickly swelled to \"nearly two thousand, (who) set plantations on fire, destroyed haciendas and materials, stole, and killed whites.‚Äù It was several months before ‚Äúorder‚Äù was reestablished.

The enslaved planned to kill all the island‚Äôs enslavers in a single explosion during a large ball held in St. John. They needed this opportunity to smuggle a 10-gallon barrel of gunpowder into the building to blow it up. The blast, seen for miles, would signal other enslaved people on their surrounding plantations to rise into action. After the massacre, Prince Klaas would be crowned as leader of a new black kingdom on the island. ‚ÄúOf course, they were betrayed by their own, one slave gave all the details of the impending attack, and the existing magistrate thwarted it. After arrests and under interrogation with occasional torture involved, 32 enslaved people confessed their involvement, and 132 were convicted of participating in it. Of this number, five, including Klaas, were broken on the wheel, six were gibbeted (hung in irons until they died of hunger and thirst), and 77 others were burned at the stake.‚Äù",

(Image 1) The rebellion began when a group of about 20 enslaved Africans, led by Jemmy, from Angola\/Congo, gathered near the Stono River, south of Charleston, and stole weapons from a store. (Image 2) They then marched south towards Florida, where they hoped to find freedom, beating drums, and shouting \"liberty!\" along the way, and recruited other slaves to join them. As they marched, others joined them, with their number swelling to over 100. The rebels' ultimate goal was to reach Spanish Florida, where they hoped to find freedom, as the Spanish were known for offering asylum to slaves who escaped from the British colonies.(Image 3) They burned plantations and decapitated a few whites and left their heads on the porch. One slave hid his master, and another alerted his of the revolt, both were rewarded with their freedom. When they arrived at the Edisto bridge, they stopped and performed a war dance that led to their demise as they were shot down. A group of white settlers and soldiers near the Edisto River intercepted them, A battle ensued, and most rebels were killed. the South Carolina militia eventually suppressed the rebellion. In the end some twenty-five whites were killed before the insurrection was put down. At its height, approximately 150-200 enslaved were involved, sixty-five of them died. Those who captured were executed or sold into slavery in the West Indies. The aftermath was stricter slave codes and harsher treatment of slaves in the South; it also served as a reminder of the constant threat of slave uprisings and fueled fears of insurrection among white plantation owners.

				"Description": "Francois Makandal was a notorious Maroon leader who's goal was to use his base to kill all the whites. He was an educated Muslim and religious leader from West Africa and was captured as a prisoner of war and sold into slavery. Francois Mackandal was enslaved at the age of 12, after losing his hand in processing sugar cane he was assigned to care for the livestock. He escaped from a plantation around 1740 and escaped to the Maroon community where he organized the Maroons to attack the French in a series of battles. He could not get support of the Mulattos to purchase munitions so he used his extensive knowledge of plants to conjure up poisons that was used to kill whites, livestock and other slaves and killed approximately six thousand people within three years. His ultimate plan was to poison the water systems and attack the city. He said he, \"... was sent by God to Santo Domingue to destroy the whites and free the Blacks.\" He was apprehended in 1858 and condemned to be burned alive at the stake where he escaped again but was subdued and executed adding to the tale of his supernatural powers.",

The revolt was eventually suppressed, but at a tremendous cost in human lives. The other leader, Coffy, had planned the revolt as the domestic slaves were dissatisfied with the working conditions and treatment they received. In Feb, 1763, roving bands of slaves began burning plantations, the white settlers left after yellow fever had decimated their population and fled to another island. The Dutch brought in troops from other islands to recapture Berbice, it took 13 months of guerrilla style fighting before the Dutch regained control. Coffy wanted to negotiate with the Dutch, but not Accara who believed the Dutch would not negotiate. Coffy later commited suicide rather than be subjugated to the Dutch. .",

				"Description": "The Irish presence in Montserrat dates back to the 1630s when the first pioneers- Roman Catholics ‚Äì sailed over from Saint Kitts because of friction with British protestant settlers there. The Irish planters brought enslaved Africans to work the sugarcane fields, who soon outnumbered them 3 to 1. Other Irish immigrants were initially deported to the islands by the British as indentured workers on sugar and tobacco plantations and could work their way into eventually becoming landowners. 70% of all white citizens on the island claimed to be of Irish heritage and celebrate St. Patrick‚Äôs Day with the same spirit of gluttony and vitality. In 1768, the enslaved planned an uprising on that holiday, when the planters were celebrating, hoping their Irish overseers would be too drunk to interfere. The holiday seemed a prime opportunity for a revolt: Cudjo, the leader, spent months devising the plan where they were instructed to grab all the weapons they could find inside the government house while the Irish slept and storm the building with rocks, farm tools, clubs, and homemade swords. Revolt details leaked by a female enabled the Irish to ready themselves for the attack by not consuming alcohol. Nine plan developers, including Cudjo, were hung, and others were convicted and shipped off to other islands. Today people mix their annual celebration of shamrocks and green beer with memories of the enslaved African revolt against Irish planters. Montserratians commemorate the day with a Masquerade, where islanders dance the Irish jigs one night, then mock their one-time masters the next by cracking whips while dressed in tall hats like bishops‚Äô miters.",

				"Description": "(image 1) The 1789 Slave revolt in Guadeloupe was a significant event in the island's history. The revolt began on August 20, 1789, when a group of enslaved Africans rose up against the plantation owners and the French colonial government. The spark that ignited the revolt was the news of the French Revolution, which had begun earlier that year and inspired the enslaved Africans to demand their freedom. African people had an Underground communication system that informed them of the international wars and their impact on slavery. Some whites went as far as to spell words so Africans couldn't know, but they translated the letters. The rebels managed to take control of several towns and plantations on the island, and for a brief period, it seemed that they might succeed in overthrowing the colonial government. However, the French authorities eventually sent troops to suppress the revolt, and after several weeks of fighting, the rebels were defeated. The aftermath of the revolt was brutal. Many rebels were executed, and hundreds of others were sold to plantations in other colonies. However, the rebellion did have a significant impact on the fight against slavery in the French Empire, as it helped to bring the issue to the forefront of public debate and contributed to the eventual abolition of slavery in France and its colonies in the 19th century.

The French Revolution opened the question of the equal status of free Blacks. Some political forces wanted the gens de couleur to be equal because they were a major force in suppressing slave revolts; however, that designation threatened the hierarchy of white domination and superiority. This conundrum is going to play out in many ways that will ultimately lead to the abolition of slavery. The gens de couleur would form different alliances based on what they viewed as advantageous to themselves, leading the enslaved into supporting their campaigns under the pretense of being pro-abolitionists, some were ,some weren't. This battle involved thousands of slaves, led by those who declared themselves \"citizens\", when met by the French they proclaimed they \"...had killed masters who had tried to arm them against the patriots, (and) forcibly integrated themselves into the Republic\", they were then left alone to continue their armed campaign.",

				"Description": "Tula, also known as Tula Rigaud, was an African man enslaved on the island of Cura√ßao, in the Dutch West Indies, who liberated himself and led the Cura√ßao Slave Revolt of 1795 with the assistance of another enslaved man and a woman. They traveled through the island gathering other enslaved people from surroundinig plantations and marched through the island destroying property and lives. The revolt, which began on 17 August 1795, lasted for more than a month. He was executed on 3 October 1795. This rebellion was precipitated from the harsh conditions the enslaved were under to increase productivity, certain privileges that had been granted were withdrawn like no work on Sundays. In addition, the Black network had information on the revolt in Haiti and also the defeat of the Dutch by the French and it was hoped that reforms made in the Batavian Republic would come to Curacao and abolish slavery. Tula led a month long rebellion along with another man and woman They traveled across the island gathering up many enslaved to assist that swelled up to 1,000-they demanded end to collective punishment; no work on Sunday and ability to buy clothes and other supplies outside their plantation and later freedom. Negotiations broke down and they were suppressed, Tula was publicly executed. The revolt was led by Tula, Bastiaan Carpata and a woman and lasted one month, until suppressed by the \"Corps of Free Coloreds and Blacks in the field...\" The revolt began on one plantation where about fifty slaves refused to work, they then traveled to other plantations recruiting like-minded enslaved.",

				"Description": "Jamaica's Second Maroon War (insert image 1) (insert image 2) began when the Maroons of Trelawny Town felt mistreated under Cudjoe's Treaty of 1739 which ended the First Maroon War. Even though that treaty head required the Maroons to return any runaway slaves, there was still distrust and friction over the Maroon's relationship with those enslaved. The planters used the excuse of increased interaction between the Marooners and enslaved people, often marrying and having children thus assisting in their escape, as the basis to break the Treaty of 1738, setting the stage for the second war. The spark ignited the war when two Trelawny Maroons who stole a pig were imprisoned and beaten; six Maroon representatives, led by Montague James and Major Jarrett, went to the British officials with their grievance, and they, too, were imprisoned(insert image 3). (insert image 4) Following orders from the new governor, Alexander Lindsey, 6th Earl of Balcarres, the British wrongly believed the French had infected the Maroons with their revolutionary spirit. Balcarres completely mishandled the dispute, which could have been resolved without conflict. Still, he ignored the advice of local Planters and ordered his forces to put down the Maroons of Trelawny Town. Although the Maroons were outnumbered, the British troops couldn't traverse the terrain and suffered heavy losses and the destruction of large plantations. Unfortunately, the other Maroon communities did not assist; Accompong Maroons supported the British. The Trelawny Marrons were finally subdued and promised not to be deported in exchange for begging for forgiveness; however, they were still deported(Insert image 5).",

				"Description": "(Insert image 1) In 1791, some of the enslaved had requested their liberty and were met with violence, the men were decapitated, and the women and children also received harsh punishment. This occurrence remained utmost in the minds of the enslaved. The period of the French Revolution in Saint Lucia was the most tumultuous in the history of the island and of Soufriere. Everyone rallied to the slogan, Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√© for different reasons. Soufriere became the headquarters of the ‚ÄúPatriotes‚Äù the Revolutionary Party. The British attempted to seize the colony from the French in 1795, and were met by the Patriotes, made up of radical French, Africans, and Indigenous people. The Africans also took advantage of that time to fight for their freedom. (Image 3) A mulatto woman, Flore Bois Gaillard a.k.a Piton Flore, was a principal strategist in the Battle of Rabot or Brigands war. She teamed up with a group of newly freed slaves, the Brigands, to defeat the British through guerilla tactics. The Battle of Rabot, one of the critical events of the ‚ÄúBrigands War‚Äù was fought on April 22, 1795. The souvenir sheet shows the forces' disposition and the battle plan. (Image 2) The British from Castries landed over a thousand troops at Vieux Fort and marched them overland to Soufriere. They attacked on April 22 at Fond Doux and Rabot. A crucial battle took place on that day, proving the Brigands‚Äô military tactics and prowess so they could hold on to the town of Soufriere. However, destruction was widespread, as whites were attacked and the estates torched. (Image 4) Seven of the eleven towns and villages were destroyed. Castries and Soufriere, and Gros Islet were spared. The English withdrew to Castriesand were eventually defeated, fleeing the island. The Royalist planters fled with them, leaving the remaining Saint Lucians to enjoy ‚Äúl‚ÄôAnn√©e de la Libert√©‚Äù, ‚Äúa year of freedom from slavery‚Ä¶‚Äù The war ended in November 1797 with an agreement by the British that the Brigands would not be re-enslaved but repatriated to Africa. At the war's end, the Brigands were recruited into the 1st West India Regiment, which was stationed in Sierra Leone. They served in the Regiment with honor. (Image 5)",

Garbriel was literate and a skilled Blacksmith, probably a skill he learned from his father. Although well acquainted with Christianity and the bible, he did not become a minister. His skills afforded him the ability to be hired out in Richmond, Virginia. Gabriel was informed by the politics of the day, the discontent between the political parties and the aftermath of the French Revolution with the calls of equality, fraternity and democracy. Prosser chose a Saturday as a large number of Blacks going into town would not alert the slave patrollers. HIs plan was to organize free and enslaved Blacks, \"...march on Richmond under a flag reading 'Death or Liberty'\", seize the city's armory and force the planters to release their slaves. It rained that day so the revolt was postponed to the next day, long enough for one of the slaves to change his mind and alert the officials. Twenty-seven Blacks were executed including Gabriel's two brothers. Francesca Gamber in Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Junius Rodriguez ,eds. Greenwood Press: 2006:, pp. 393-395.",

Afro-Argentines believed that the British expedition came mainly to give them their independence, but the British general, William Carr Beresford, had no sympathy with this movement. The spokesman for the Creoles in Buenos Aires, Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n argued that the region's economic base would be ruined if slavery were immediately abolished. He demanded action on behalf of their estates; General Beresford announced that slaves would not be freed, and Pueyrred√≥n said \"they were stopped in time\" (\"se los ataj√≥ a tiempo\") in July 1806, in a letter to his father-in-law in C√°diz.[citation needed] This measure contributed to the defeat of the British invasion, because it drove the slaves to fight against them.\"",

				"Description": "Plans for the revolt were leaked by a \"loyal slave to his master\". This rebellion was planned by Hausa and Male,' both slave and free, by those residing in one of the Quilombos. There were a number of factors: there were class conflicts in Portugal that led to popular revolts that spilled in to Brazil that wanted local autonomy. Inspite of the demand for sugar, there was severe poverty caused by droughts; and enslavement with wide wealth disparities that increased the cost of living. The African slaves suffered from harsher working conditions and food shortages there was also class (and color) divisions within the free people of color population. Life in the Quilombos provided the Africans a space to practice their traditional culture and honor their ancestral deities. The government ordered attacks on these communities to deter any rebellious activites and instill a \"sense of obedience and deference toward their owners and to whites in general\" The government raids uncovered a number of weapons among the rebels. There was \"An intricate secret organization...with a \"captain\" in every Parish of he city and an overall commandor...\"Eleven individuals involved were punished with 150 lashes followed by a banning of all assemblies and restriction of movement.",

There were nearly 200 enslaved people involved, and dispatched federal troops killed or captured most of the warriors.

Most Northerners and foreigners were more appalled by the measures taken to suppress the rebellion and the revenge on the Black population of wantonly executing Blacks; one writer \"...exclaimed that 'VILLAINOUS WHITES' in the slaveholding states had 'reduced to the level of the beasts of the field.'\" (Insert image 6) ( insert image 7) (insert image 8) (Insert image 9) ( insert image 10)",

				"Description": "The 1821 Xiorro Conspiracy was a failed attempt to overthrow Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico. The conspiracy was led by a black slave named Marcos Xiorro, a member of the militia in the city of San Juan who planned a plot against the enslavers in the government of Puerto Rico. The plan was that several enslaved people were to escape from various plantations and on themselves with daggers and swords that were hidden in the fields(insert image 1). Xiorro and his followers planned to take over the city and declare independence from Spain. They had scheduled to launch their revolt on Easter Sunday of 1821 to capture and burn the Bayamo town and kill everyone who was not black. After that, they would unite with slaves from joining towns and invade the capital of San Juan to declare Xiorro as their king ( insert image 2). A Royal slave divulged the plans in exchange for 500 pesos and his freedom. The Mayor mobilized 500 soldiers; Xiorro and several other conspirators were arrested and charged with sedition and conspiracy. A total of 61 enslaved people were imprisoned, 17 were punished, and Xiorro was sentenced to death by hanging and publicly executed in San Juan on June 8, 1824. (insert image 3).",

				"Description": "On Easter Sunday,1822, a slave rebellion occurred on the Plein Palais Estate because of the harsh working conditions. The slaves demanded a three-day holiday and enquired when they would be set free (insert image 1); the manager refused to assure them, so they set the estate on fire. The rebellion was led by Emmanuel, an enslaved laborer on a plantation in the island's southern region. Emmanuel and his followers launched a coordinated attack on several plantations in the area using machetes, axes, and other makeshift weapons to attack their oppressors and seize control of the estates. The rebellion was initially successful, and the rebels held off British troops for several days. However, the British eventually regrouped and launched a counterattack, using their superior firepower to crush the uprising. \"Many died from the raging flames, and others were shot when the militia appeared on the scene...\" (insert image 2) Emmanuel and several other rebellion leaders were captured and executed, while many other rebels were punished severely. \"Three of the leaders were beheaded with an axe in Woodford Square. (insert image 3) Their bodies hung in chains on the various estates where slave societies existed, while the heads remained exposed in the Square. It took four years to crush the remnants of the rebellion.\" (insert image 4) The revolt's aftermath led to even harsher treatment of enslaved Africans on the island.",

He abhorred slavery and was able to plan the most extensive revolt in history that had approximmately 9,000 slaves involved. He warned his combatants to not tell any house slaves, ofcourse one did and the revolt was foiled. The plan was to attack six points simultaneously,\"... take control of military strongholds: arsenals, guardhouses, powder magazines, and naval stores...kill as many whites as possible (including women and children).

The enslaved people under Christian missionary influence believed in pacifism and didn't want violence; some even helped to suppress the rebellion. They also believed that British Parliament had abolished slavery. They were met with a show of force by the British troops and were massacred.(insert image 4) (insert image 3) (insert image 6) The bullet-riddled body of Quamina, bound in chains, was put on public show. John Smith, a missionary, was accused of inciting the rebellion and was tried and found guilty. He died in prison. His death stirred more anti-slavery opinion in Britain than the deaths of the many who had been killed from the guns of British troops. The aftermath led to the execution of over 200 enslaved to \"send a message.\" (insert image 7) The governor of Barbados wrote, \"Now the ball has begun to roll no one can say where or when it is going to stop.\" News of the rebellion and ensuant atrocities caused an outcry in Britain against the practices of the planters and played a decisive role in the abolition of slavery!

Unlike previous slave revolts -- led by alliances between free people of color and slaves, blacks and mulattoes, Africans and Creoles, and rural and urban populations -- only African-born men organized the uprising of 1825. From this year onwards, Barcia argues, slave uprisings in Cuba underwent a phase of Africanization that concluded only in the mid-1840s with the conspiracy of La Escalera, a large movement organized by free colored men with ample participation of the slave population. In 1826, several slaves rebelled in Guira.",

				"Description": "Nat Turner revolt is the most well known of all. At the height of the revolt, 50 slaves were involved as they traveled from plantation to plantation killing approximately 60 men, women and children mostly through decapitation. As they made their way to Jerusalem the recruits wanted to rest and disbanded it was this uncalculated move that gave the local militias the opportunity to attack. Nat's band had decreased to no more than thirty where they stopped to rest, the next morning they attacked Belmont where the rest of Turner's force was dispersed. Nat Turner found himself alone and retuned to the Travis plantation where the rebellion began-it took two months for the authorities to locate him, he was hanged and skinned. (the skins of Black people were used to make book covers, belts and wallets-also used as souvenirs) In retaliation, over 200 Blacks were killed, many had never even heard of Nat Turner. As a result, petitions to end slavery poured into the Virginia legislature instead of abolition the \"lawmakers passed harsher laws making the lives of the slaves even worst\"",

This revolt was the compendium of historical actions ranging from capturing Muslims as prisoners of war by the jihad of Usman dan Fodio in northern Nigeria that led to 8,307 Nago (early name of Yoruba), Hausa, Ewe, and Fulani Muslims to be deported to Bahia. Betrayal led to the suppression of the first rebellion in 1807 by Muslim Hausa; the police found talismans among the weapons, sheets of paper that people believed were sacred and would protect them. Others were not discouraged even after the leader received 150 lashes and was condemned to death. In 1808, the day after Christmas, several hundred Africans fled the plantations and attacked the town of Nazare das Farinhas. Those who escaped roamed for months, \"setting houses on fire, stealing and killing. A third revolt took place on February 28, 1814...six hundred men assaulted the fisheries where they had been employed and the town of Itapoan\". (JR 305) \"Between 1816 and 1830, sixteen uprisings and conspiracies had occurred on the sugar plantations surrounding San Salvador de Bahia. Muslims were identified as leaders in at least five of these events and were participants in all.\"",

This call evidences the competition of the unemployed with the enslaved during that down economic period. (image 2) In 1839 the governor sent in 400 troops, who were quickly defeated. The rebellion attracted many runaway slaves under the leadership of Cosme Bento das Chagas, the leader of a slave community who called for the end of slavery. In 1840 the new governor sent in 8,000 troops and defeated the \"rebels.\"",

The Matanzas plantation was located in the western part of Cuba and was known for its brutal treatment of slaves. The revolt was led by a slave named Juan Francisco Manzano, a poet, and a literate slave. He was able to organize a group of slaves and plan a rebellion against their masters. The slaves were able to seize control of the plantation and hold off the Spanish authorities for several weeks. The Spanish army eventually put down the rebellion, but not before the slaves had caused significant damage to the plantation and killed several of their masters. Juan Francisco Manzano was captured and imprisoned but eventually escaped to the United States, where he became a permanent abolitionist. Officials tried to keep other Africans from finding out, particularly the railroad workers, but they did, and the crowd swelled. In the end, over 100 Africans were killed, eight were shot, and their heads were put on spikes to deter others.",

The rumor of conspiracies was also directed to rebelling against Spanish rule, precipitating societal repression by the Spanish authorities. Africans took advantage of Spanish rule's political instability and destroyed countless properties. The Spanish authorities brutally suppressed the rebellion who executed hundreds of rebels and suspected sympathizers. The term \"Year of the Lash\" generally refers to the harsh response toward the would-be uprising by Cuban authorities. Thousands of Afro-Cubans (both slave and free) were executed, imprisoned, or banished from the island. The targeted leaders of the conspiracies were primarily artists, politically astute persons, and artisans, including carpenters, blacksmiths, and shoemakers, who had some degree of education and social mobility. La Escalera (the ladder) alludes to the fact that slave suspects were bound to ladders and whipped with the lash when they were interrogated.",

Edward Gorsuch heard his slaves were on Parker's land, so he and others, including his son, attempted to recapture him. When Gorsuch arrived at Parkers' door, he demanded his property, Parker responded, what are you referring to, my furniture? Parker's wife alerted the neighbors to Gorsuch and his men, who responded with clubs, scythes, and other farming tools. Fighting ensued with a shooting that left Gorsuch dead and his son injured. (Image 3) Thirty-eight men, including four Quakers, were accused of treason and eventually released, signaling a blow to the law!",

				"Description": "\"James Dyson, a white, Jamaican-born British national is arrested and charged with plotting a slave rebellion. There were mainly rumours that circulated around his case. He was a school teacher and had previously been charged with aiding a slave who was embezzling money . The rumours suggested that he had planned an attack on an armory, rob the banks and the stores in order to arm the plantation slaves to attack the city and kill all who opposed them Although no hard evidence was found, a fugitive slave was found on his premises and a few weapons. He stayed in prison for three years and then died of typhoid fever in 1856.

Many left the plantations and settled their own farms or merchant enterprises. The Morant Bay Rebellion was initiated by a group of Afro-Jamaicans who had been freed from slavery in the 1830's and had settled on land owned by a white. Litigation ensued and the Afro-Jamaicans were told they had to bear the court costs. Enraged, they returned to the land in question and squatted. Reverend Paul Bogle got involved in the protest, that led to the courthouse being burned down and the looting of properties. Hysteria from previous revolts loomed so what began \"...as a local protest concerning taxes and larceny resulted in the death of 350 toilers, the executions of Paul Bogle and George William Gordon on charges of sedition and the termination of local government.

(Image 2) Major slave rebellions broke out on both islands (Pemba)...and were quickly suppressed.\" (Image 3) In 1873, an enslaved man named Hemedi bin Abdallah and his followers led a revolt in which they attacked their Arab enslavers and seized control of Stone Town in Zanzibar. They then marched to other parts of the island, freeing slaves, and killing planters. The revolt then spread to Pemba, where slaves rose against the Arabs. The rebels captured several towns and villages and established their own government. The British, who had a protectorate over Zanzibar, intervened to abolish the revolt. They bombarded the rebels with artillery and eventually defeated them. Hemedi was captured and executed, along with several other rebel leaders. The rebellion also inspired other slave uprisings in East Africa and contributed to the eventual abolition of slavery in the region.(Image 4)",

Bartle Frere then sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand after this ultimatum was not met.Th e war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the Battle of Isandlwana, followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at Rorke's Drift by a small force of British troops.

				"Description": "Up until it was briefly held by Italy in 1931 to 1945, Ethiopia was the only African territory that resisted complete colonization by Europeans. Italy did indeed colonize part of ancient Ethiopia, the area along the Red Sea that became known as the independent country, Eritrea. However, under the leadership of Emperor Menelik II, Ethiopia resisted European attempts to colonize all of the country. Ethiopia won a decisive victory over Italy at the Battle of Adowa in December 1895. During the battle, Menelik‚Äôs warriors attacked with a ferocity the Italians couldn‚Äôt have imagined. Taking hardly any prisoners, the victors of Battle of Adowa killed 289 Italian officers, 2,918 European soldiers and about 2,000 Askari (Africans who fought on the side of Europeans). Another 954 European troops were missing, while 470 Italians and 958 Askari were wounded. Some 700 Italians and 1,800 Askari fell into the hands of the Ethiopian troops.

The Sultan Attahiru I hated the British and chose to migrate but was blocked by the Brits and killed. This laid the foundation for the Satiru Uprising that had underlying religious competitions that was overrode by desire to expel the Brits. The defeat of the people was more than physical as it was a spiritual assault and a lesson by the Brits that they were superior and rebellions would not be tolerated. \"Mahdist Triumph and British Revenge In Northern Nigeria: SATIRU 1906\" R.

This was the largest rebellion in the British West Indies involving some 20,000 slaves and was lead by Sam Sharpe whose main plan was a 'General Strike' against slavery. If the demands of the strike were not met then there was to be military and arson attacks. 'An extensive and destructive insurrection' broke out in the Western District. The Great House and sugar works at Kensington Estate in St. James were set on fire. Other arson attacks on plantations followed. 201 rebels were killed in fighting the combined forces of the British army, navy and local militia. Some 750 slaves and 14 free persons were put on trial and convicted to death or severe flogging (200 - 500 lashes). 21 were transported. When Sharpe was waiting to be executed (May, 23rd, 1832) he said, \"I would rather die upon yonder gallows than live in slavery!\"",

Bodies were dumped in unmarked graves while the white press cheered a victory against a fledgling black union. It was one of the bloodiest days in United States labor history, and while statues went up and public places were named for some of those involved, there is no marker of the Thibodaux Massacre...Days after, a local planter widow Mary Pugh wrote, ‚ÄúI think this will settle the question of who is to rule the nigger or the white man for the next fifty years.‚Äù It was a far-sighted comment‚Äî black farm workers in the South wouldn‚Äôt have the opportunity to unionize for generations...Sensing they were in a strong bargaining position, workers banded together in several sugar parishes, including St. Mary, Iberia, Terrebonne, and Lafourche, demanding cash wages of $1.25 per day, or $1.00 if meals were included. But the growers refused, upset that African-American workers were demanding an end to their paternalistic work regime. So African-American leaders like Hamp Keys, a former Terrebonne Parish legislator, called a strike. https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/history\/thibodaux-massacre-left-60-african-americans-dead-and-spelled-end-unionized-farm-labor-south-decades-180967289\/",
