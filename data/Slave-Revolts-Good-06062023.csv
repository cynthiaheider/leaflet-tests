FALSE,03Aob2,FALSE,,1700,1768,1768,Montserrat,,"The Irish presence in Montserrat dates back to the 1630s when the first pioneers- Roman Catholics - sailed over from Saint Kitts because of friction with British protestant settlers there. The Irish planters brought enslaved Africans to work the sugarcane fields, who soon outnumbered them 3 to 1. Other Irish immigrants were initially deported to the islands by the British as indentured workers on sugar and tobacco plantations and could work their way into eventually becoming landowners. 70% of all white citizens on the island claimed to be of Irish heritage and celebrate St. Patrick‚Äôs Day with the same spirit of gluttony and vitality. In 1768, the enslaved planned an uprising on that holiday, when the planters were celebrating, hoping their Irish overseers would be too drunk to interfere. The holiday seemed a prime opportunity for a revolt: Cudjo, the leader, spent months devising the plan where they were instructed to grab all the weapons they could find inside the government house while the Irish slept and storm the building with rocks, farm tools, clubs, and homemade swords. Revolt details leaked by a female enabled the Irish to ready themselves for the attack by not consuming alcohol. Nine plan developers, including Cudjo, were hung, and others were convicted and shipped off to other islands. Today people mix their annual celebration of shamrocks and green beer with memories of the enslaved African revolt against Irish planters.
