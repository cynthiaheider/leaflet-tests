However, the Spanish authorities quickly responded to the rebellion, sending troops to suppress the uprising. The rebels were defeated after several battles; many were captured, forty slaves were shot, and many fled the island.

    "description":"There is limited information available about a slave revolt in Santa Marta, Colombia in 1533. However, historical records indicate that there was a rebellion of African slaves against their Spanish masters in the region at that time. According to some sources, the revolt was led by an African slave named Juan de Palomino, who had been brought to Colombia from the Congo. The slaves attacked and burned Spanish settlements and plantations, killing many of their masters. The Spanish authorities eventually crushed the revolt and punished the rebellious slaves harshly. Palomino and other leaders of the revolt were executed, and many other slaves were subjected to brutal torture and punishment. The 1533 slave revolt in Santa Marta was one of the earliest recorded slave uprisings in the Americas, and it demonstrated the deep-seated resentment and resistance that many African slaves felt towards their European masters.",

    "description":"There is historical evidence of a slave revolt that took place in Cartagena, Colombia, in 1550. A group of enslaved Africans led the rebellion brought to the region by Spanish colonizers to work on sugar plantations and in mines. The rebellion began when a group of slaves, led by an enslaved African named Bayano, escaped from their plantation and fled to the mountains. There, they formed a community of escaped slaves and began to raid Spanish settlements, freeing other enslaved people and attacking their former masters. The rebellion was successful for a time, and the escaped slaves managed to gain control of a large part of the region. However, the Spanish authorities eventually crushed the revolt and captured Bayano and other rebellion leaders. Bayano was executed, and many other slaves were punished harshly, including torture, mutilation, and being burned alive. Despite this, the revolt had a lasting impact on the region, and it helped to inspire other slave rebellions throughout the Americas",

Many other revolts were happening near this event on the islands. Whites in St. Kitts were much alarmed when a band of 60 women revolted in the French Quarter and fled to the hills. Then in November of that same year, more than 60 enslaved Africans from the Capisterre region left their plantations and found refuge on the slopes of Mount Misery. Accompanied by their women and children, they protected themselves by the surrounding environment on a mountainous precipice that a narrow strip of land could only approach. This vantage point enabled them to pillage the plantations of the slaveholders. After a stint of pillaging and destruction, they were eventually overtaken by an army of 500 men who destroyed and disbanded their stronghold. They were killed, punished, and made examples of to eliminate the attempts and actions of future rebellions by other enslaved people.",

It was found that this was only the first stage of an even wider revolt. The four were tried and executed, women were burned alive as based on British common law.",

The plan was launced on Sunday, April 6th as Sabbath was designated by law as a day of worship. The rebels organized and took a blood oath of secrecy and had magic powder sprinkled on themselves as protection from bullets. They set fire to the outhouse and when the whites appeared they attacked and killed 9 whites and injured 7 others. They were captured, six committed suicide rather that go to trial. \"Thirty-nine slaves stood trial for murder, witnesses were called to provide testimony, and surprisingly thirteen slaves were acquitted and an additional three slaves were later pardoned. A pregnant rebel had her execution suspended, and Britain's Queen Anne pardoned a slave named Marrs, as well as the Spanish Indians who had participated\".",

    "description":"1725-40 (circa) The Windward Maroons were led by Nanny and the Leeward Maroons were led by Cudjoe. Nanny ruled as an African Queen and an Obeah Woman and carried on African culture and traditions amongst her people. When there was fighting the women and children under her protection would hide in 'Girls' Town' or 'Women's Town' in the John Crow Mountains. Nanny made a vow on Pumpkin Hill in 1737 to fight the British to death. When she did sign the treaty with the British she was wearing the teeth of her dead British enemies. She established Nanny Town which is still in existence. In 1977 she was awarded the posthumous honour of 'National Heroine'.",

    "description":"1725, 1726, 1727 (insert image 1) (insert image 2) Insurrections believed to have been precipitated by the successful African mutiny of the French vessel the Vautour. The Africans were on deck and watching the sellers looking for signs of weakness when one left to get a drink, Africans grabbed an axe and within seconds the others grabbed tools that were unsecured in a barrel, they armed themselves with shackles and cannon balls from another barrel. One sailor who noticed the insurrection was killed right away a few of them hadn't had their ankle irons locked so they were able to attack others(insert image 4). It took the Malagasy only a few minutes to seize the deck the crew was not prepared to deal with this revolt nor did they have access to weapons. The commotion got the attention of a ship that was nearby, the Alcyon, that tried to subdue the ship by firing a cannon in it and then sailing on small boats close to the ship, but the Africans found guns and shot at them(insert image 3). As the Vautour ran aground, many Africans jumped overboard some were shot by the French on the Alcyon but the other survivors ran away The Vautour was beyond repair. This event limited the numbers of Africans taken from this country.",

The Spanish left their enslaved populations on the island , many of whom had fled to the mountains of the country. There were two major maroon groups totaling in the several thousands. The leeward group was led by Cudjoe and his brothers Accompong and Johnny. The other group, the Windwards was led by Cuffee, Quao, Kishee and the infamous female leader Nanny. The struggle with the British lasted well over nine years with the British conceding to negotiations. The British even used armed Blacks called \"Blackshots\" but many of them wound up negotiating with the Maroons and supplying them with munitions. The Maroon populations not only fought the British but frequently attacked European settlements for arms and rations. The negotiations gave land to the Maroon popuation if they agreed to return runaway slaves to the British, they also wanted to be repatriated to West Africa but were not allowed to return. Mark G.

    "description":"Prince Klaas, an enslaved West African, coordinated an elaborate plot against the white rule in Antigua. The enslaved planned to kill all the island‚Äôs enslavers in a single explosion during a large ball held in St. John. They needed this opportunity to smuggle a 10-gallon barrel of gunpowder into the building to blow it up. The blast, seen for miles, would signal other enslaved people on their surrounding plantations to rise into action. After the massacre, Prince Klaas would be crowned as leader of a new black kingdom on the island. \"Of course, they were betrayed by their own, one slave gave all the details of the impending attack, and the existing magistrate thwarted it. After arrests and under interrogation with occasional torture involved, 32 enslaved people confessed their involvement, and 132 were convicted of participating in it. Of this number, five, including Klaas, were broken on the wheel, six were gibbeted (hung in irons until they died of hunger and thirst), and 77 others were burned at the stake.\"",

In just one day, five hundred men and a few women, representing one-third of the region's captives, had abandoned their work and resorted to violence...the number of rebelling slaves reached nearly two thousand; they set plantations on fire, destroyed haciendas and materials, stole, and killed whites....order was not reestablished until several months later, leaving no historical record of the exact number of victims, those convicted and the slaves who were able to join the runaways in the mountains.

The rebels' ultimate goal was to reach Spanish Florida, where they hoped to find freedom, as the Spanish were known for offering asylum to slaves who escaped from the British colonies.(Image 3) They burned plantations and decapitated a few whites and left their heads on the porch. One slave hid his master, and another alerted his of the revolt, both were rewarded with their freedom. When they arrived at the Edisto bridge, they stopped and performed a war dance that led to their demise as they were shot down. A group of white settlers and soldiers near the Edisto River intercepted them, A battle ensued, and most rebels were killed. the South Carolina militia eventually suppressed the rebellion. In the end some twenty-five whites were killed before the insurrection was put down. At its height, approximately 150-200 enslaved were involved, sixty-five of them died. Those who captured were executed or sold into slavery in the West Indies. The aftermath was stricter slave codes and harsher treatment of slaves in the South; it also served as a reminder of the constant threat of slave uprisings and fueled fears of insurrection among white plantation owners.

There were also free Blacks in the region along with the enslaved who were becoming economically mobile. The government decided to limit their ascendency by instituting a tax. (Image 1) These Blacks had already bought their freedom and did not want to pay it so they moved into the Quilombo, Campo Grande, one of the largest in Brazil. It was there that a plan was devised to kill all the white and mulatto men and spare the women. This plot is significant since it lends credence to why the whites feared the Black communities.",

He was an educated Muslim and religious leader from West Africa and was captured as a prisoner of war and sold into slavery. Francois Mackandal was enslaved at the age of 12, after losing his hand in processing sugar cane he was assigned to care for the livestock. He escaped from a plantation around 1740 and escaped to the Maroon community where he organized the Maroons to attack the French in a series of battles. He could not get support of the Mulattos to purchase munitions so he used his extensive knowledge of plants to conjure up poisons that was used to kill whites, livestock and other slaves and killed approximately six thousand people within three years. His ultimate plan was to poison the water systems and attack the city. He said he, \"... was sent by God to Santo Domingue to destroy the whites and free the Blacks.\" He was apprehended in 1858 and condemned to be burned alive at the stake where he escaped again but was subdued and executed adding to the tale of his supernatural powers.",

The revolt was eventually suppressed, but at a tremendous cost in human lives. The other leader, Coffy, had planned the revolt as the domestic slaves were dissatisfied with the working conditions and treatment they received. In Feb, 1763, roving bands of slaves began burning plantations, the white settlers left after yellow fever had decimated their population and fled to another island. The Dutch brought in troops from other islands to recapture Berbice, it took 13 months of guerrilla style fighting before the Dutch regained control. Coffy wanted to negotiate with the Dutch, but not Accara who believed the Dutch would not negotiate. Coffy later commited suicide rather than be subjugated to the Dutch. ",

    "description":"The Irish presence in Montserrat dates back to the 1630s when the first pioneers- Roman Catholics - sailed over from Saint Kitts because of friction with British protestant settlers there. The Irish planters brought enslaved Africans to work the sugarcane fields, who soon outnumbered them 3 to 1. Other Irish immigrants were initially deported to the islands by the British as indentured workers on sugar and tobacco plantations and could work their way into eventually becoming landowners. 70% of all white citizens on the island claimed to be of Irish heritage and celebrate St. Patrick‚Äôs Day with the same spirit of gluttony and vitality. In 1768, the enslaved planned an uprising on that holiday, when the planters were celebrating, hoping their Irish overseers would be too drunk to interfere. The holiday seemed a prime opportunity for a revolt: Cudjo, the leader, spent months devising the plan where they were instructed to grab all the weapons they could find inside the government house while the Irish slept and storm the building with rocks, farm tools, clubs, and homemade swords. Revolt details leaked by a female enabled the Irish to ready themselves for the attack by not consuming alcohol. Nine plan developers, including Cudjo, were hung, and others were convicted and shipped off to other islands. Today people mix their annual celebration of shamrocks and green beer with memories of the enslaved African revolt against Irish planters. Montserratians commemorate the day with a Masquerade, where islanders dance the Irish jigs one night, then mock their one-time masters the next by cracking whips while dressed in tall hats like bishops‚Äô miters.",

Some whites went as far as to spell words so Africans couldn't know, but they translated the letters.

    "description":"The slave rebellion of trois rivie'res illustrates the tenuous yet strategic position of the the free Blacks in Martinique, Guadeloupe and Haiti or Lesser Antilles, also known as the gens de couleur. this group was basically heterogeneous, some were very rich that led to their alliances with white planters and others were poor farmers. The French Revolution opened the question of the equal status of free Blacks. Some political forces wanted the gens de couleur to be equal because they were a major force in suppressing slave revolts; however, that designation threatened the hierarchy of white domination and superiority. This conundrum is going to play out in many ways that will ultimately lead to the abolition of slavery. The gens de couleur would form different alliances based on what they viewed as advantageous to themselves, leading the enslaved into supporting their campaigns under the pretense of being pro-abolitionists, some were ,some weren't. This battle involved thousands of slaves, led by those who declared themselves \"citizens\", when met by the French they proclaimed they \"...had killed masters who had tried to arm them against the patriots, (and) forcibly integrated themselves into the Republic\", they were then left alone to continue their armed campaign.",

The revolt, which began on 17 August 1795, lasted for more than a month. He was executed on 3 October 1795. This rebellion was precipitated from the harsh conditions the enslaved were under to increase productivity, certain privileges that had been granted were withdrawn like no work on Sundays. In addition, the Black network had information on the revolt in Haiti and also the defeat of the Dutch by the French and it was hoped that reforms made in the Batavian Republic would come to Curacao and abolish slavery. Tula led a month long rebellion along with another man and woman They traveled across the island gathering up many enslaved to assist that swelled up to 1,000-they demanded end to collective punishment; no work on Sunday and ability to buy clothes and other supplies outside their plantation and later freedom. Negotiations broke down and they were suppressed, Tula was publicly executed. The revolt was led by Tula, Bastiaan Carpata and a woman and lasted one month, until suppressed by the \"Corps of Free Coloreds and Blacks in the field...\" The revolt began on one plantation where about fifty slaves refused to work, they then traveled to other plantations recruiting like-minded enslaved.",

They wrote a letter on May 17, 1793 on behalf of \"one million slaves\" and asked for the immediate abolition of slavery and launched a joint campaign. The new constitution enacted on June 24, 1793, specified that no one could be sold.",

    "description":"Gabriel Prosser's life and planned insurrection highlights the contradictions and nuances of slavery. Garbriel was literate and a skilled Blacksmith, probably a skill he learned from his father. Although well acquainted with Christianity and the bible, he did not become a minister. His skills afforded him the ability to be hired out in Richmond, Virginia. Gabriel was informed by the politics of the day, the discontent between the political parties and the aftermath of the French Revolution with the calls of equality, fraternity and democracy. Prosser chose a Saturday as a large number of Blacks going into town would not alert the slave patrollers. HIs plan was to organize free and enslaved Blacks, \"...march on Richmond under a flag reading 'Death or Liberty'\", seize the city's armory and force the planters to release their slaves. It rained that day so the revolt was postponed to the next day, long enough for one of the slaves to change his mind and alert the officials. Twenty-seven Blacks were executed including Gabriel's two brothers.",

Afro-Argentines believed that the British expedition came mainly to give them their independence, but the British general, William Carr Beresford, had no sympathy with this movement. The spokesman for the Creoles in Buenos Aires, Juan Martín de Pueyrredón argued that the region's economic base would be ruined if slavery were immediately abolished. He demanded action on behalf of their estates; General Beresford announced that slaves would not be freed, and Pueyrredón said \"they were stopped in time\" (\"se los atajó a tiempo\") in July 1806, in a letter to his father-in-law in Cádiz.[citation needed] This measure contributed to the defeat of the British invasion, because it drove the slaves to fight against them.\"",

    "description":"Plans for the revolt were leaked by a \"loyal slave to his master\". This rebellion was planned by Hausa and Male,' both slave and free, by those residing in one of the Quilombos. There were a number of factors: there were class conflicts in Portugal that led to popular revolts that spilled in to Brazil that wanted local autonomy. Inspite of the demand for sugar, there was severe poverty caused by droughts; and enslavement with wide wealth disparities that increased the cost of living. The African slaves suffered from harsher working conditions and food shortages there was also class (and color) divisions within the free people of color population. Life in the Quilombos provided the Africans a space to practice their traditional culture and honor their ancestral deities. The government ordered attacks on these communities to deter any rebellious activites and instill a \"sense of obedience and deference toward their owners and to whites in general\" The government raids uncovered a number of weapons among the rebels. There was \"An intricate secret organization...with a \"captain\" in every Parish of he city and an overall commandor...\"Eleven individuals involved were punished with 150 lashes followed by a banning of all assemblies and restriction of movement.",

The repression left Recife and gained importance to exterminate the supposed quilombo where \"seeds of sedition\" germinated. In 1816, the material was searched, resulting in the imprisonment of 37 blacks (with several nations: ussá, fulani, haussá and some \"from Costa da Mina\") and 1 white man. In the end, the black Joaquim, considered the mastermind of the sedition, was executed and the others sentenced to flogging and exile.",

Only a premature start to the rebellion enabled the white population to gain an upper hand otherwise at least large portions of the island would have gone to the rebels. Captured rebels, when questioned, said that ill-treatment was not the cause of their revolt but that the island belonged to them and they were going to kill every white man on it. 214 slaves executed, 123 transported were the official figures. The real death total is thought to be something like 1,000 slaves killed and executed. Bussa was thought to be the main leader of the rebellion other leaders included Jackey, Davis, King Wiltshire, Dick Bailey, Johnny and a woman named Nanny Grigg.",

These Maroons fought the US government in a series of wars first in 1817-1818 and again in 1835-42. Fort Blount came under attack for several days before being by US troops and the Blacks and Indians suffered major casualties. John Caesar, a Black Seminole survived and organized forces for the second war During this time they liberated hundreds of slaves by seizing surrounding plantations. The US military lost approximately 1,500 men and spent $20 million for this \"slave catching enterprise\" In the end, President Adrew Jackson managed to defeat the Seminole and had them relocated through the \"Trail of Tears\".",

Unlike previous slave revolts -- led by alliances between free people of color and slaves, blacks and mulattoes, Africans and Creoles, and rural and urban populations -- only African-born men organized the uprising of 1825. From this year onwards, Barcia argues, slave uprisings in Cuba underwent a phase of Africanization that concluded only in the mid-1840s with the conspiracy of La Escalera, a large movement organized by free colored men with ample participation of the slave population. In 1826, several slaves rebelled in Guira.",

At the height of the revolt, 50 slaves were involved as they traveled from plantation to plantation killing approximately 60 men, women and children mostly through decapitation. As they made their way to Jerusalem the recruits wanted to rest and disbanded it was this uncalculated move that gave the local militias the opportunity to attack. Nat's band had decreased to no more than thirty where they stopped to rest, the next morning they attacked Belmont where the rest of Turner's force was dispersed. Nat Turner found himself alone and retuned to the Travis plantation where the rebellion began-it took two months for the authorities to locate him, he was hanged and skinned. (the skins of Black people were used to make book covers, belts and wallets-also used as souvenirs) In retaliation, over 200 Blacks were killed, many had never even heard of Nat Turner. As a result, petitions to end slavery poured into the Virginia legislature instead of abolition the \"lawmakers passed harsher laws making the lives of the slaves even worst\"",

On September 22, 1848, King Frederick VII decreed the official abolition of slavery in the Danish West Indies. The crowd didn't dissipate immediately, a soldier began firing into the crowd which set off riots that lasted a few days. The planters response to emancipation was the enactment of strict codes on Black laborers,although slavery ended, the relationship between Blacks and the planters and the institutions that supported Black oppression remained.",

The plan that was uncovered was devised by Blacks and some abolitionists to burn down many structures and assassinate the whites. Once Northern Texas was disabled they would move to destroy the munitions in Dallas. At that point Blacks from surrounding areas would be brought into finally cripple the state. This plot resulted in a \"fastening down\" on the movements of Blacks within the state.",

Many left the plantations and settled their own farms or merchant enterprises. The Morant Bay Rebellion was initiated by a group of Afro-Jamaicans who had been freed from slavery in the 1830's and had settled on land owned by a white. Litigation ensued and the Afro-Jamaicans were told they had to bear the court costs. Enraged, they returned to the land in question and squatted. Reverend Paul Bogle got involved in the protest, that led to the courthouse being burned down and the looting of properties. Hysteria from previous revolts loomed so what began \"...as a local protest concerning taxes and larceny resulted in the death of 350 toilers, the executions of Paul Bogle and George William Gordon on charges of sedition and the termination of local government.

    "description":"British Commander Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply, including disbanding his army and abandoning key cultural traditions. Bartle Frere then sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand after this ultimatum was not met.Th e war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the Battle of Isandlwana, followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at Rorke's Drift by a small force of British troops. The war eventually resulted in a British victory and the end of the Zulu nation's dominance of the region. ",

Italy did indeed colonize part of ancient Ethiopia, the area along the Red Sea that became known as the independent country, Eritrea. However, under the leadership of Emperor Menelik II, Ethiopia resisted European attempts to colonize all of the country.(image 2) Ethiopia won a decisive victory over Italy at the Battle of Adowa in December 1895. During the battle, Menelik‚Äôs warriors attacked with a ferocity the Italians couldn‚Äôt have imagined. Taking hardly any prisoners, the victors of Battle of Adowa killed 289 Italian officers, 2,918 European soldiers and about 2,000 Askari (Africans who fought on the side of Europeans). Another 954 European troops were missing, while 470 Italians and 958 Askari were wounded. Some 700 Italians and 1,800 Askari fell into the hands of the Ethiopian troops.

Here we see the complicity of the African royalty in the trade at certain points in history but also the manipulation by the Portuguese to pressure them into the \"trade\". The Portuguese violated terms of the trade and came under attack during one of the wars. Although these years were interspersed with leaders who did try to end the trade such as Queen Nzinga; however, they were dismissed because of the profitability of the exploitation of human cargo.

If the demands of the strike were not met then there was to be military and arson attacks. 'An extensive and destructive insurrection' broke out in the Western District. The Great House and sugar works at Kensington Estate in St. James were set on fire. Other arson attacks on plantations followed. 201 rebels were killed in fighting the combined forces of the British army, navy and local militia. Some 750 slaves and 14 free persons were put on trial and convicted to death or severe flogging (200 - 500 lashes). 21 were transported. When Sharpe was waiting to be executed (May, 23rd, 1832) he said, \"I would rather die upon yonder gallows than live in slavery!\"",
